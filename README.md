## Inspiration:

- The inspiration behind the East Side Bamboo Development project was to provide a solution for the import and export of bamboo poles from India.
- The project aims to help users interested in the bamboo industry by providing a web application that includes resources, research, and development of bamboo species, as well as news related to the field.
- The addition of a chatbot helps users to solve their queries, and the ability to become an exporter by applying for an agent account from the exporter section helps to streamline the process of importing and exporting goods from India.

## What it does:

The East Side Bamboo Development web application is designed to help users import and export bamboo poles from India. The web application provides users with resources related to the bamboo industry, including research and development projects, blog posts, and news related to the field. The chatbot feature helps users to solve their queries quickly and efficiently, while the ability to become an exporter by applying for an agent account from the exporter section provides users with a streamlined process to import and export goods from India.

## How we built it:

The East Side Bamboo Development project was built using the Django Framework, which allowed for the development of a scalable and efficient web application. The backend was built using the sqlite3 database, while Celery and Redis were used to automate the reminder process and for reservation of stocks. Razorpay SDK was used for payment gateway integration, while Courier API was used for notification purposes.

## Challenges we ran into:

- Integrating the chatbot feature into the web application was one of the main challenges faced during the development process.
- Implementing the agent account feature and the import and export verification process was also a challenge.
- Ensuring the scalability of the web application to accommodate fluctuations in the price of bamboo poles was another challenge.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of:

- The development of the East Side Bamboo Development web application has provided a solution for the import and export of bamboo poles from India, which was previously a challenge for users in the industry.
- The integration of various features, such as the chatbot and agent account verification, has streamlined the process of importing and exporting goods from India.
- The ability to provide users with resources related to the bamboo industry, including research and development projects and news related to the field, has made the East Side Bamboo Development web application a one-stop solution for users in the industry.

## What we learned:

- Developing the East Side Bamboo Development project helped us to learn about the challenges faced by users in the bamboo industry and how technology can help provide solutions to these challenges.
- The development process helped us to learn about the integration of various features, such as chatbots and payment gateways, into a web application.
- We also learned about the importance of scalability in a web application, especially in industries where the price of goods may fluctuate.

## What's next:

- The East Side Bamboo Development web application can be expanded to include more features, such as the ability to track the transportation of goods and provide users with updates on their shipments.
- The web application can also be expanded to include resources related to other industries, providing a one-stop solution for users across various industries.
